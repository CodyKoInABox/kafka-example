how to run everything:
- clone the repo
- get docker running
- run the docker compose: ``docker-compose up -d``
- install all js packages: ``npm install``
- then on three separate terminals:
- run the server: ``node server.js``
- run the website: ``http-server``
- run the consumer: ``node consumer.js``
- pretty sure thats it hopefully it works during the presentation
